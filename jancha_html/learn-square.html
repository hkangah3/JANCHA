                <h1>The Square</h1>
                <h3>The Square provides a balanced mix of convenience, 
                    comfort, and affordability for PVAMU students. Located 
                    right next to campus, The Square offers apartment-style 
                    living with shared common areas, spacious layouts, and a 
                    friendly student community. It’s a strong option for 
                    students who want more independence than a dorm while still 
                    staying close to university life, classes, and resources.
