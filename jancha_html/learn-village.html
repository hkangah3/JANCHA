                <h1>The Village</h1>
                <h3>The Village is designed specifically for 
                    sophomores who are ready for more freedom and 
                    independence after their first year. With spacious 
                    apartment-style layouts, full kitchens, and a calmer 
                    atmosphere, The Village gives students the next step 
                    up from freshman housing while still keeping them close 
                    to the PVAMU campus. It’s a comfortable, balanced environment 
                    where sophomores can focus on academics, enjoy a little more 
                    privacy, and grow into their own routine.

                <h3>The Village gives sophomores a true upgrade from freshman housing 
                    with full kitchens, spacious living rooms, and apartment-style layouts 
                    that feel more like home. It’s the perfect next step for students who 
                    want more comfort and independence without moving completely off campus.

            <div class="benefit-box">
                <h1>freedom with Support</h1>
                <h3>At The Village, students get more independence and fewer restrictions 
                    than first-year dorms, but still benefit from having staff and campus 
                    resources close by. It’s a balanced environment that lets sophomores 
                    grow while still having help available when they need it.

                <h1>Social but Calm</h1>
                <h3>The Village has a friendly, laid-back atmosphere that makes it 
                    easy to meet people without dealing with constant noise or chaos. 
                    Shared living spaces encourage connection, while private bedrooms 
                    and a quieter setting give students room to recharge and focus.
