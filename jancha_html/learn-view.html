                <h3>The View offers modern, upper-class style living designed for students 
                    who want independence, comfort, and a quiet environment to thrive. 
                    Located just minutes from campus, The View provides spacious apartments, 
                    private bedrooms, full kitchens, and a relaxed community atmosphere that’s 
                    perfect for focused studying and everyday living. With upgraded interiors and 
                    essential amenities, it’s one of PVAMU’s most convenient and comfortable 
                    off-campus options.

                    supports focus and productivity. It’s perfect for students who need a 
                    peaceful space to handle coursework, study, or work on personal projects.
